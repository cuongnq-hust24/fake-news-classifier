# Fake News Classifier

This project uses a machine learning model to classify news articles as **FAKE** or **REAL** based on their content. The model is trained using a Passive Aggressive Classifier and a TfidfVectorizer for text feature extraction.

## Project Structure

- `model/`: Contains the trained model and vectorizer.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for training and evaluating the model.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for using the model for predictions.
- `data/`: (Optional) Sample dataset for testing purposes.

## Dependencies

The dependencies required for this project are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
